- 👋 Hi, I’m @TechUnabled4real
- 👀 I’m interested in learning about blockchain, crypto, and all that is happening so quickly in the technology space.
- 🌱 I’m currently trying to learn and catch up on a lot before I know where I can best focus my attention.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on properly using and implementing decentralization and blockchain technology. 
- 📫 How to reach me is probably best by email. Travispelletier123@gmail.com. I'm not sure if/where it is but I had gone through setting up repository at one point.
